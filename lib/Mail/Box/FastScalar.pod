Mail::Box::FastScalar - fast alternative to IO::Scalar




=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contributed by "Todd Richmond" (richmond@proofpoint.com)  This package
should be released as separate package, but till then is incorporated
in the Mail::Box module.

Extremely fast L<IO::Scalar> replacement - >20x improvement in
getline(s)()

=head2 Warnings

You cannot modify the original reference between calls unless you
C<$obj->seek(1, 0)> to reset the object - VERY rare usage case

$/ must be undef or string - "" and \scalar unimplemented

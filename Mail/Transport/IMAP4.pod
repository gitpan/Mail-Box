Mail::Transport::IMAP4 - handle messages via the IMAP4 protocol

=head1 CLASS INHERITANCE

Mail::Transport::IMAP4
   is a Mail::Transport::Receive
   is a Mail::Transport
   is a Mail::Reporter

=head1 SYNOPSIS


 my $imap = Mail::Transport::IMAP4->new(...);
 my $message = $imap->receive($id);
 $imap->send($message);

=head1 DESCRIPTION


UNDER DEVELOPMENT: Cannot be used yet.

The IMAP4 protocol is quite complicated: it is feature rich and allows
verious asynchronous actions.  The main document describing IMAP is
rfc2060.

This package, as part of Mail::Box, does not implement the actual
protocol itself, but uses Mail::IMAPClient to do the work.  The task
for this package is to hide as much differences between that module's
interface and the common Mail::Box folder types.  This package is used
by Mail::Box::IMAP4 for the real work.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Initiation

=over 4

=item B<new> OPTIONS X<new>

Create the IMAP connection to the server.  IMAP servers can handle
multiple folders for a single user, which means that connections
may get shared.  This is sharing is hidden for the user.

 OPTION               DEFAULT
 authenticate         'AUTO'
 hostname             'localhost'
 interval             30
 log                  'WARNINGS'
 password             undef
 port                 143
 proxy                undef
 retry                <false>
 timeout              120
 trace                'WARNINGS'
 username             undef
 via                  'sendmail'

=over 4

=item B<authenticate> =E<gt> 'KERBEROS_V4'|'GSSAPI'|'SKEY'|'AUTO' X<new(authenticate)>

Authenthication method.  RFC1731 defines a few authentication methods
to be (optionally) used with IMAP. NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.

=over 4

=item B<receive> [UNIQUE-MESSAGE-ID]

See Mail::Transport::Receive::receive()

=back

=head2 Exchanging Information

=over 4

=item B<deleteFetched>  X<deleteFetched>

Mark all messages that have been fetched with message() for deletion.  See
fetched().

=item B<deleted> BOOLEAN, ID's X<deleted>

Either mark the specified message(s) to be deleted on the remote server or
unmark them for deletion (if the first parameter is false).  Deletion of
messages will take place B<only> when the connection is specifically
disconnected or the last reference to the object goes out of scope.

=item B<disconnect>  X<disconnect>

Break contact with the server, if that (still) exists.  Returns true if
successful.  Please note that even if the disconnect was not successful,
all knowledge of messages etc. will be removed from the object: the object
basically has reverted to the state in which it was before anything was done
with the mail box.

=item B<fetched>  X<fetched>

Returns a reference to a list of ID's that have been fetched using the
message() method.  This can be used to update a database of messages that
were fetched (but maybe not yet deleted) from the mailbox.

Please note that if the IMAP4 server did not support the UIDL command, this
method will always return undef because it is not possibly to reliably
identify messages between sessions (other than looking at the contents of
the messages themselves).

See also deleteFetched().

=item B<folderSize>  X<folderSize>

Returns the total number of octets used by the mailbox on the remote server.

=item B<header> ID, [BODYLINES] X<header>

Returns a reference to an array which contains the header of the message
with the specified ID.  C<undef> is returned if something has gone wrong.

The optional integer BODYLINES specifies the number of lines from the body
which should be added, by default none.

Examples:

 my $ref_lines = $imap4->header($uidl);
 print @$ref_lines;

=item B<id2n> ID X<id2n>

Translates the unique ID of a message into a sequence number which
represents the message as long a this connection to the IMAP4 server
exists.  When the message has been deleted for some reason, C<undef>
is returned.

=item B<ids>  X<ids>

Returns a list (in list context) or a reference to a list (in scalar context)
of all ID's which are known by the server on this moment.

=item B<message> ID X<message>

Returns a reference to an array which contains the lines of the
message with the specified ID.  Returns C<undef> if something has gone
wrong.

Examples:

 my $ref_lines = $imap->message($uidl);
 print @$ref_lines;

=item B<messageSize> ID X<messageSize>

Returns the size of the message which is indicated by the ID, in octets.
If the message has been deleted on the remote server, this will return
C<undef>.

=item B<messages>  X<messages>

Returns (in scalar context only) the number of messages that are known
to exist in the mailbox.

=back

=head2 Protocol [internals]

=over 4

=item B<askSubfolderSeparator>  X<askSubfolderSeparator>

Returns the separator which is used on the server side to indicate
sub-folders.

=item B<askSubfoldersOf> NAME X<askSubfoldersOf>

Returns a list of subfolders for this server.

=item B<getFlag> ID, LABEL X<getFlag>

Returns the value of the LABEL for the message with this ID.

=item B<send> SOCKET, data X<send>

Send data to the indicated socket and return the first line read from
that socket.  Logs an error if either writing to or reading from socket failed.

This method does B<not> attempt to reconnect or anything: if reading or
writing the socket fails, something is very definitely wrong.

=item B<sendList> SOCKET, COMMAND X<sendList>

Sends the indicated COMMAND to the specified socket, and retrieves the
response.  It returns a reference to an array with all the lines that
were reveived after the first C<+OK> line and before the end-of-message
delimiter (a single dot on a line).  Returns C<undef>
whenever something has gone wrong.

=item B<setFlags> ID, LABEL, VALUE, [LABEL, VALUE], ... X<setFlags>

=item B<socket>  X<socket>

Returns a connection to the IMAP4 server.  If there was no connection yet,
it will be created transparently.  If the connection with the IMAP4 server
was lost, it will be reconnected and the assures that internal
state information (STAT and UIDL) is up-to-date in the object.

If the contact to the server was still present, or could be established,
an IO::Socket::INET object is returned.  Else, C<undef> is returned and
no further actions should be tried on the object.

This program was written in December 2000.  This is quite recent, so
please check for a new version: new programs often get many changes
in their first months.

The most important parts of the module were tested (see the test-scripts)
but quite some things didn't get tested yet.  Please contribute with
tests and fixes, were needed.  Even the tested parts, however, may still
contain problems, because the number of tests is still small.

TO BE TESTED (and improved):
  thread discovery
  file-lock
  nfs-lock
  sub-folders
  delete folders
  appending to unopened folders

TO BE IMPLEMENTED:
  Thread lint
  extracting large message-parts into persistent external files

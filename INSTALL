INSTALL  Mail::Box

Usually, you install any perl module simply by calling

  #   perl -MCPAN -e 'install Mail::Box'

but if you want to do it manually, then execute the following.
First unpack the archive:

  #   tar xzf Mail-Box-2*.tar.gz
  #   cd  Mail-Box-2.*[0-9]

Then
  #   perl Makefile.PL
  #   make test
  #   make install

=== Dependencies

Some modules are not obligatory to Mail::Box, but can improve the
functionality.  Obligatory are

  Date::Parse      used to parse date info in the header
  File::Spec       to copy files and construct paths
  IO::Scalar       only required to run the tests
  Errno            Mail/Box/Locker/File
  Scalar::Util     to weaken references
  Object::Realize::Later implements delay loading
  Mail::Address    mail address parsing.  Will be replaced later
  MIME::Types      to find required encoding on data-types.

Optionally, you may want to install

  Mail::Internet   when you want to link to packages which require it.
  MIME::Entity
  Inline::C        will enble the C-based parser

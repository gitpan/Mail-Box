CHANGELOG of Mail::Box version 2

All changes were made by Mark Overmeer <mark@overmeer.net>, unless
specified differently.

NOTE: The number of changes and fixes for each release seem large, but
      usually limited to areas which are under development.  Mail::Box
      is a huge module, so there is always a lot of activity.

version 2.025: Mon Sep 23 13:11:57 CEST 2002

	Fixes:

	- Accidentally left debug-printstatements in Mail::Transport::SMTP

	- Fixed from address in Mail::Transport::SMTP

	Improvements:

	- MIME-Version header line automatically added to constructed
	  messages (rfc 2045). [Matthew Darwin]

version 2.024: Sun Sep 22 23:06:55 CEST 2002

	Fixes:

	- SMTP sending accidentally only included the headers *not* to
	  be disclosed :(  The check has the correct negation in
	  Mail::Message::Field::toDisclose() now.
	  Reported by [Matthew Darwin]

	- Generated messages without message-id must get one assigned.
	  Reported by [Matthew Darwin]

	Improvements:

	- All tests converted to use Test::More, which produces better
	  feedback on failures. Hopefully, failures on Windows will
	  start disappearing now.

	- Mail::Box::Dir::Message's take their size from the real
	  file (unless they are modified)

	- Mail::Box::Mbox now derived from new Mail::Box::File

	- Mail::Box::Mbox::Message now derived from new
	  Mail::Box::File::Message.

	- Set the shape of the message-id with
	  Mail::Message::Head::messageIdPrefix()

	- A message constructed without data will be an empty text
	  message, not an empty multipart :(

	- Mail::Message::Construct::build() now calls buildFromBody()
	  to prepare the whole message, instead of doing it itself.
	  You can also specify field objects to buld() now.

	- From and To fields are no longer required to construct a
	  message.  They may be filled-in later.

	- Mail::Message::Construct::bounce() now uses the
	  MM::Head::ResentGroup object, which much improved outcome.

	- Made a start with Mail::Box::Search::SpamAssassin.

version 2.023: Sat Sep 14 11:11:03 CEST 2002

	Fixes:

	- t/65search.t failed for some Perl versions, dependent on the
	  hash implementation.  Mail::Box::Search::Grep::inHead did
	  not use MM::Head::orderedFields() yet. Discovered by
	  [Blair & Liz & Greg & Conrad Heiney]

	- Mail::Box::Mbox includes IO::File with () to avoid colission
	  between constant definitions in IO::File and POSIX.  Fixed
	  by [Marcel Gruenauer]

version 2.022: Mon Sep  9 18:55:01 CEST 2002

	Detailed checks against RFC2822 is in progress, which means that
	some changes have to be made.  The API had to be changed on some
	places, but on most places could be kept unchanged.

	Application breakers:

	- $msg->from now returns a list fo addresses!  Mind the context!
	  required by the RFC.

	- stringified $body->type returns whole Content-Type body.  Use
	  $body->mimeType!  Example:
	     if($msg->type eq 'text/html')     # breaks now
	     if($msg->mimeType eq 'text/html') # works as always

	- a header field stringifies to "body; comment", not only
	  the body.

	Fixes:

	- Messages which of unknown Content-Type (unknown by MIME::Types)
	  could cause segmentation violates.  Solved by [Darrell Fuhriman]

	- In Mail::Box::Manager, the method foldertypes() was called, which
	  should have been folderTypes(). [Swapnil Khabiya]

	- Mail::Message::Construct::replyPrelude produced warning when
	  from address of originating message dit not defined a user's
	  name.  Now it has a fallback. Reported by [Jon Thomason]

	Improvements:

	- new method Mail::Box::Message::moveTo()

	- new method Mail::Message::sender()

	- Mail::Message::Convert::selectedFields() retuns fields now
	  (in the right order), not field names.

	- Mail::Reporter::log() now also as class method.

	- Mail::Reporter::defaultTrace() to set program global defaults
	  for logging and tracing.

	- New class Mail::Message::Head::ResentGroup with tests in
	  t/12head1r.t

	- Mali::Message::Construct::printStructure now accepts a filehandle.

	- reply() takes return address from: Reply-To || Sender || From
	  (Sender added)

	I have re-read specification rfc2822, and reimplemented the three
	Mail::Message::Field* objects.  The next changes are made to
	these objects:

	- field data is only stored in folded form to improve performance
	  during parsing and reduce memory consumption (which is quite
	  high for headers) but also to be able to handle structured fields
	  better.  This introduced two new methods:
	    folded_body()
	    unfolded_body()
	  The body(), comment(), and content() are quite different now,
	  although return the same results.

	- toDate() without argument returns an rfc2822 valid date
	   representing the current local time.

	- new() accepts attributes.  The OPTIONS are only available
 	  for ::Flex fields.                                    

	- attributes handle escapes of quotes in quoted strings.

	- new method length() which returns the total field length.

	- new method toDisclose() which tells
	  Mail::Message::Head::printUndisclosed whether the header should
	  be visible for extenal receivers.

	- new method stripCFWS() removes comments and folding white space from
	  header lines.  This should only be used on structured header
	  fields.  Tests in t/11cfws.t

	- new method dateToTimestamp converts a date in RFC2822 spec into
	  a timestamp.

	Also Mail::Message::Head got revisited.  The order of the fields
	is protected stronger.

	- new method orderedFields()

	- new method addResentGroup()

	- new method resentGroups()

	- new method removeField($field)

version 2.021: Tue Aug 20 17:42:24 CEST 2002

	Fixes:

	- Requires HTML::TreeBuilder release 3.13 or newer, if you want to
	  use Mail::Message::Convert::HtmlFormat*.pm, because 3.12 contains
	  a serious bug.  Resolved by [Blair Zajac]

	- A mistake in the previous release could cause that parts of
	  multiparts where lazy.  This is not correct: all parts must be
	  extracted at once.  Detected by [Jost Krieger]

	- Another bug introduced with the previous release was the
	  removal of automatic body-to-messagepart coercion.

	- When a nested body was checked on encoding, it accidentally returned
	  its nested content, in stead of itself.  Detected by [Blair Zajac]

	- Mail::Message::isMultipart triggered the body, which is not needed
	  because the info is in the header as well.

	- pod2html translators are terrible.  Put more sofistication in
	  my html-polisher.

	Improvements:

	- Carp is stringifying objects, which is terrible in combination with
	  overloading stringification on message headers and bodies.  Therefore,
	  a special exception for stringification is added to return a
	  different result to Carp.

	- The Mail::Box::determineBodyType is simplified.

	- Multiparts and Nested (rcf822) message are now also delayed when
	  their size is not known (often the case) or too large.

	- Implemented Mail::Message::Part::buildFromBody() to assist the
	  improved Mail::Message::Part::coerce()

	- Testing cloning of complex messages in t/58clone.t

version 2.019: Thu Aug 15 09:46:42 CEST 2002

	Fixes:

	- Parsing messages could destroy $_ and IN/OUT file-handles from
	  the user's program.  Found a few places in Mail/Message/Body/*.pm
	  Problem spotted by [Jerrad Pierce]

	- Mail::Message::Head::Delayed extends a Mail::Message::Head, not
	  a Mail::Reporter.

	- Using an Index with MH folders caused each message header to be
	  triggered: a considerable slowdown.

	Improvements:

	- [Blair Zajac] donated a large set of documentation fixes.
	  Even some hidden bugs got fixed this way.

	- Implemented Mail::Message::Body::Multipart::file(), because
	  it is required for Mail::Transport::SMTP.  Spotted by
	  [Marty J. Riley]

	- Mail::Box::Tie::ARRAY and ::HASH simulate real arrays and hashes
	  better with respect to deleted items.

	- Mail::Box::Message::Dummy is renamed into Mail::Message::Dummy,
	  which inherit from Mail::Message, not Mail::Box::Message.

	- Mail::Message::Dummy's now follow the standard pattern of
	  Mail::Message.

	- The Mail::Box::Thread::Manager is now also an extension of a
	  Mail::Reporter.

	- The Mail::Box::Thread::Node is now also extends Mail::Reporter.

	- Added extra doc to MH::Message to avoid confusion between seqnr
	  and filename (which is a number as well).  Needed by
	  [Jerrad Pierce]

	- Mail::Message::Part::clone is not a special case of clone at all.
	  Removed.

	- Mail::Message::Part::coerce() was much too complicated: most work
	  is already done in Mail::Message::coerce()

	- The documentation and sometimes also the location of code in
	  Mail::Message::Head* packages has been improved.

	- Improvements in text of Mail::Box-Overview.

version 2.018: Wed Jul 10 23:03:08 CEST 2002

	Fixes:

	- Parser will immediately study multipart en nested messages,
	  because otherwise it will get stuck in nasty multi-level
	  situations.  Discovered by [Francois Petillon]

	- More picky with quotes in header field attributes...  Continuing
	  story with weird multipart boundary strings.  This time,
	  [Blair Zajac] forced some improvements.

	- Empty headers were not properly skipped.  Usually this went
	  undetected...  however not in a very rare case [Blair Zajac]

	- For read-only folders, the manager always complained about
	  "closing changed folders".  Reported by [Blair Zajac] and fixed.

	- [Greg Matheson] tries to get Mail::Box running on the Cygwin
	  platform, which will benefit everyone, because it is stricter
	  than UNIX in some cases.... for instance, the Perl parser 
	  objects left the file-handle open....

	- [Blair Zajac] detected that double messages in a read-only
	  folder cause "Changes not written to read-only folder"
	  messages.  Not anymore: the doubles will not be flagged for
	  deletion.

	Improvements:

	- Filenames sometime contained double /'s between folderdir and
	  foldername.  Removed.

	- Foldernames can be specified like this:
	     pop3://username:password@host:port/folder
	  which is broken into separate arguments in a very early stage.
	  This is especially useful when the name is passed in $ENV{MAIL}

	- Start of implementation for Mail::Transport::POP3.

	- To make space for ::POP3, which is a message receiver, the
	  message senders are now derived from Mail::Transport::Send.
	  New options are added which certainly improve the interface.
	  New packages:
	     Mail::Transport::Send
	     Mail::Transport::Receive
	     Mail::Transport::POP3
	  
	- Foldernames via $mgr->open() may be specified as URL, for instance
	     $mgr->open('mbox:/tmp/inbox')
	     $mgr->open('pop3://me:secret@pop3.server.com:120')

	- $mgr->close($folder) and ->closeAllFolders() accept the
	  normal options for $folder->close(OPTIONS).

	- $folder->appendMessage($msg) now returns the coerced message.

	- Mail::Box::Dir::messageId() should not trigger headers to
	  find unparsed headers with the id: that's the task of
	  Mail::Box::find().  The code was not consistent with the docs.

	- Removed Mail::Box::Dir::readAllHeaders()... it contained a
	  bug, so was apperently never used.  And that's a good thing.

	- Small set of additions to Mail::Box::Net and Mail::Box::POP3
	  Still in the early stages of development.

	- The parser will complain about files which were modified while
	  it was working with it.  Some cases where the parser accidentally
	  stayed open were closed to resolve the complaints for the tests.

version 2.017: Fri Jul  5 17:06:08 CEST 2002

	Fixes:

	- Thanks to [Liz Mattijsen] for the detection of some flaws in
	  the QuotedPrintable encoding.  Fixed it.

	- Nested (rfc822) message clone() did not work.  Detected by
	  [Blair Zajac]

	- [Greg Matheson] is fixing the test suite for Windows.  Very good
	  work.  Changes made in t/65search.t

	Improvements:

	- Deleted parts will not be returned in $multipart_body->lines

	- Deleted parts will not be counted in $multipart_body->nrLines
	  and ->size

	- Deleted parts will not be cloned.

	- For efficiency reasons, $multipart_body->foreachComponent
	  will skip deleted parts as well.

	- Mail::Box::messages() accepts
             range:       $folder->messages(3, 100)
             non-deleted: $folder->messages('ACTIVE')
             deleted:     $folder->messages('DELETED')
             labeled:     $folder->messages('seen')
             labeled:     $folder->messages('!seen')
	     code:        $folder->messages( sub {$_[0]->size > 10000} )
	  limiting the default result being all messages.

	- Mail::Message::parts() accepts
             non-deleted: $msg->parts('ACTIVE')
             deleted:     $msg->parts('DELETED')
	     nested:      $msg->parts('RECURSE');
	     code:        $msg->parts( sub {$_[0]->size > 10000)} )

	- Mail::Message::Body::Multipart::parts accepts
             non-deleted: $body->parts('ACTIVE')
             deleted:     $body->parts('DELETED')
	     nested:      $body->parts('RECURSE');
	     code:        $body->parts( sub {$_[0]->size > 10000)} )

	- Mail::Box::allMessageIds() renamed to messageIds(), but old
	  name still available.

	- Add suggestion to close() without writing changes.

	- Avoid testing of maildir folders for Windows.  They are not
	  supported, because maildir uses characters in filenames which
	  are not acceptabled for the Windows file-systyem. [Greg Matheson]

	- Added Mail::Box::POP3, Mail::Box::POP3::Message
          Mail::Box::Net, and Mail::Box::Net::Message as first steps to
	  a POP3 implementation.

version 2.016: Tue Jun 25 16:24:54 CEST 2002

	Fixes:

	- [Edward Wildgoose] was very persist in pushing me to test
	  return codes in Mail::Transport::SMTP.  Late transport failures
	  are reported back now.

	- [Jeff Squyres] attributes in header fields must be matched
	  case-insensitive.

	- $folder->writeable --> $folder->writable, but old method
	  kept for backwards compatibility.

	- [Andreas Piper] AIX also requires r+ on a file to get locking
	  via FLOCK to work.  I made the detection 'compile-time'.

	- The folder to be locked was optional, but used in error messages.
	  Now if is not optional anymore, thanks to [Andreas Piper]

	- Simulated sub-folders in Mbox were not correctly automagically
	  created.

	Improvements:

	- Document fixes in Mail/Transport/SMTP.pm by [Liz Mattijsen]

	- Recursive copying of whole folders, which may include
	  conversions with Mail::Box::copyTo() with tests in t/66copyto.t

	- Interface change:
            $mgr->addMessages,   $folder->addMessage,
            $mgr->appendMessage, $folder->appendMessage,
            $mgr->moveMessage,   $folder->copyMessage,
            $message->copyTo
	  now all return the coerced message(s), because that is much
	  more useful than the message which are passed into the
	  method call, the folder, or the class.

	- Mail::Box::Manager::open() is rewritten, and a such much improved.

	- Much stricter handling of folder closing and folder deletion:
	  when a manager is used, folders are removed before global
	  cleamup commences.

	- Mail::Box::Manager::registerType is not requiring all known
	  folder types anymore.  This means that adding folder types
	  is without cost now: they are compiled only when used.

version 2.015: Tue Jun 18 19:41:45 CEST 2002

	Fixes:

	- Duplicated messages without subject or to fields will
	  not produce errors anymore.

	- Duplicated messages produce NOTICE now, not WARNINGS.  Same
	  for empty fields and other minor things the parser detects.

	- Multiparts where not correctly processed when read from STDIN:
	  the body type was '::Lines' only. Bug reported by [Evan Borgstrom]

	- Bogus message-IDs  <>  caused problems, but these situations are
	  avoided now.  Problem found by [Jost Krieger]

	Improvements:

	- message/rfc822 messages are handled now via a
	  Mail::Message::Body::Nested.pm, Tests in t/21p9rfc.t
	  This all because [Max Poduhoroff] asked for it  ;-)

	- Removed all tests for Inline::C parser....

	- Mail::Message::Body::AUTOLOAD handles errors better, which
	  should provide nicer error-messages.

	- Updates on MH/Maildir messages will first be created in an
	  'invisible' name, to avoid accidental access to partially
	  written messages Mail::Box::Dir::Message::create()

	- Mail::Message::Parts can be deleted (ignored for printing and
	  sending).  $part->deleted, $part->deleted(0), if($part->deleted)

	- timestamp() prefers time from last Received field over first
	  [Jost Krieger]

	- Mail::Transport::SMTP:
	    contactServer()  --> contactAnyServer()
	    new method tryConnectTo($host, @options);

	- $msg->printStructure for debugging purposes
	  (see Mail::Message::Construct)

	- Now requires MIME::Types v1.001

	- Mail::Message $msg   implemented $msg->string, ->lines, ->file
	
version 2.014: Tue Jun 11 16:26:13 CEST 2002

	Fixes:

	- Forgot to implement the 'delete' method for a header field.  The
	  'reset' method was available to achieve it, but harder to discover
	  for unexperienced programmers.  Now 'delete' simply calls 'reset'.
	  Spotted by [Mark Weiler]

	- A coerce() from Mail::Message to Mail::Box::Message has to clear
	  the deleted flag (to avoid errors).  At the same time, the
	  modified flag is cleared.  Detected by [Max Maischein]

	- create option to Maildir's works now.

	- Signature separator '--'  ==> '-- '

	- [Gilles Darold] found that  m!(['"]?)([^\1])\1!  doesn't work.
	  apparently, [^\1] is not working.  Temporarily fixed with [^'"]
	  in Mail::Message::Field.

	Improvements:

	- Mail::Transport::SMTP is working now.

	- The 'clone' operation on a message will return a Mail::Message
	  object, which avoids complications with copying message between
	  different kinds of folders.

	- Maildir messages are moved from 'new' to 'cur' with the new
	  method 'accept'.

	- Mbox, MH, pure Perl parser, and modules status "Released" 
	 (was "beta")

	- Maildir status "Alpha" (was "under development")

	- Added some docs to Mail::Transport about receiving messages
	  via POP3.  This code may appear in the near future.

	- Implemented Mail::Message::Convert::TextAutoformat, t/90textaf.t

	- Implemented Mail::Message::Convert::HtmlFormatText, t/90htmlft.t

	- Implemented Mail::Message::Convert::HtmlFormatPS, t/90htmlfps.t

	- Initial coding of Mail::Message::Convert::Html, t/90html.t

	- Mail::Message::Head::grepNames() now accepts regexes as well.

	- Mail::Message::Field::wellformedName method added which returns
          preferred capitization of a field's name.  The name() method
          returns the lower-cased name.  Tests in t/11field1.t

	- Mail::Message::Field::content returns both body and comment
	  part of the message header line.

	- added Mail::Message::Body::charset() to simplify code.

	- removed useless Mail::Message::printUndisclosed().

version 2.013: Thu May 23 11:30:35 CEST 2002

	Fixes:

	- Create MH directories when asked to. [Greg Matheson] reported
	  the problem.

	- Mail::Box::Locker::new "timeout" and "wait" options where too
	  confusing to be implemented correctly.  So they didn't work
	  as described.  Now, they are called "expire" and "timeout".
	  Thanks to [John B Batzel] for pointing-out the problems.

	- Messages with empty bodies where not accepted at all.  This
	  combined with a mistake in treating these errors in Mbox
	  folders gave <undef>s when asked for a body.

	Improvements:

	- Maildir implementation runs all its tests.  Still there are
	  some support functions lacking.  Reports are that sub-folders
	  are to be implemented differently.

version 2.012: Mon Apr 22 15:53:05 CEST 2002

	Fixes:

	- [alex] found-out that remove_when_empty and save_on_exit
	  could not be set to false for Mail::Box'es.

	- [Cory Johns] examples/reply.pl closed the folder but
	  later still used one of its messages.  This is not
	  permitted, but may be allowed later.

	- [Robin Berjon] multiple improvements to the Maildir
	  implementation.  Not finalized yet.

	- Mail::Message::Construct->build
	  called          Body->new(filename =>
	  which must be   Body->new(file =>

	- Two fixes in Base64 encoding....  Problem reported by
	  [Bernd Patolla]

	- Forgot to use File::Copy in Mail::Message::Body::File.
	  reported by [Andre Schultze]

	Improvements:

	- Creation of new message-files for Mail::Box::Dir::Message
	  extensions implemented by a create($filename) method which
	  tries to be very smart.

	- [Mark Ethan Trostler] Mail::Message::Field::attribute
	  with value of <undef> gave complaints.  For now, these
	  calls with <undef> will be ingnored.  In the close future
	  they will remove the attribute.

	- Removed references to HTML.pm from all files...

version 2.011: Sun Mar  3 23:51:41 CET 2002

	Improvements:    -- one day of rapid development ;)

	- Mail::Message::read was confusing many users.  Therefore, it
	  has been renamed to readFromParser.

	- Now read() became unused, it is used to implement
	  my $msg = Mail::Message->read(\*STDIN);
	  Please use it sparsely.

	- Implemented Mail::Box::Maildir->writeMessages and
	  Mail::Box::Maildir->appendMessages.  Tests in t/44mdir*.t
	  Still small things to fix.

	- Mail::Message::clone() includes labels now.

version 2.010: Sun Mar  3 16:05:16 CET 2002

	Fixes:

	- Fixed serious mis-calculation for delayed bodies in MH folders.
	  The 'fail-safe' approach did safe the programs till now, but
	  it is much better now: correct 'Content-Length' headers will
	  safe you time now.

	- Improved quite some doc-issues in Mail::Box::MH::(Label|Index).pm

	- Prototype of Mail::Message::Body::_data_from_lines was @_, which
	  is a silly typo checked by bleadperl... [Marcel Gruenauer]

	- Mail::Box::Parser::Perl line 87, binmode without filehandle...
	  reported by [Marcel Gruenauer]  But now it is causing problems
	  with perlio in 5.7.2 ...

	- Minor changes to scripts/takemail by [Tassilo v Parseval]

	- Mistakes in the docs of Mail::Box::Search::Grep, found by
	  [Tassilo v Parseval]

	- Accidentally took only non-delayed messages in Grep: wrong
	  default.  Detected by [Tassilo v Parseval]

	- The METHOD INDEXes ended with a list of links to related
	  manual-pages which where not expanded correctly by pod.
	  Therefor is was changed: now the INDEX starts with the
	  man-pages which will have correct links this time.

	Improvements:

	- Changed encoders/decoders status from ALPHA to BETA.

	- Removed organization option to new() for Mail::Boxes: it is
	  not modifyable.  The method which shows whether the folder
	  is DIRECTORY or FILE organized will stay.

	- *PARTIAL* implementation of Maildir folders, which did have large
	  implications for the MH implementation.  The maildir implementation
	  is NOT READY yet.

          New class structure:

	    Mail::Box::MH
	    is a Mail::Box::Dir            <-- new
	    is a Mail::Box

	    Mail::Box::MH::Message
	    is a Mail::Box::Dir::Message   <-- new
	    is a Mail::Box::Message
	    is a Mail::Message

	    Mail::Box::Maildir             <-- new
	    is a Mail::Box::Dir            <-- new
	    is a Mail::Box

	    Mail::Box::Maildir::Message    <-- new
	    is a Mail::Box::Dir::Message   <-- new
	    is a Mail::Box::Message

	- Massive changes in label management, required to facilitate
	  Maildir labels which are in the filename.

	- Added /usr/lib to the safe_directories are searched by
	  Mail::Transport for binaries [Slaven Rezic]

	- Any Mail::Box type may implement an 'updateMessages'.  When
	  $mailbox->update is called and 'updateMessages' exists, the
	  folder tries to figure-out changes in the folder which were
	  made by external programs.  External programs may add messages
	  to the end of the folder without applying a lock, which is
	  dangerous.

version 2.009: Wed Feb 20 09:03:56 CET 2002

	Fixes:

	- Forgot to update METHOD INDEX

	- t/65search1g.t tests Mail::Box::Search::Grep, which found
	  some problems in the implementation which are fixed now.

	Improvements:

	- Mail::Box::Manager::threads() now also works when the folders
	  are not used as named parameter:
	     $mgr->threads(folders => [$inbox, $outbox]);  # was
	     $mgr->threads($inbox, $outbox);               # added

	- Default output file-handle changed from STDOUT to the selected
	  file-handle (see perldoc -f select)... usually this will
	  return STDOUT.

version 2.008: Mon Feb 18 16:11:52 CET 2002

	Fixes:

	- [Alam Kelm] proved me that the other perl modules are wrong,
	  wrapping the header-lines more often than the RFC permits.  So,
	  wrapping on ';' and '.' is removed.  Wrapped headers are always
	  accepted, so there is no difference when reading a folder.

	- Added 'use Mail::Address' to Mail::Message::Field
          [Walery Studennikov]

	- [Andreas Marcel Riechert] Added -I flag for {net|open}bsd with
          mailx in Mail::Transport::Mailx

	- The parent of a Multipart body after reading accidentally was
          a body, not a message.  Fixed in Mail::Message::Body::Multipart.

	Improvements:

	- New modules Mail::Box::Search and Mail::Box::Search::Grep, however
	  they still need testing.  De docs have to be updated too.
	  Mail::Box::Search::Spam must be a piece of cake now.
	  Example in examples/grep.pl

	- Replaced -w flag in test-scripts by 'use warnings'

	- Centralized definition of folder-files in t/Tools.pm to
	  simplify implementation on Windows.

	- t/00windows.t to convert t/mbox.src to t/mbox.win with CRLF
	  line-terminations.

	- moved Mail::Message::Body::Encode::eol to
	  Mail::Message::Body::eol because is always needed and
	  hence triggered the parsing of Encode..

	- Mail::Message::Body::eol option NATIVE will be translated into
          LF, CR or CRLF.

	- Mail::Message::Body::*::size will return the size of the
	  message as stored in the file, so taking care of \n which
	  becomes CRLF on some systems.

	- Croak when $mgr->copyTo/moveTo is used with a message which
	  is not part of a folder yet: appendMessage should be used instead.

	- Mail::Box::Thread::Node::threadMessages() collects all messages
	  which are in a thread.

version 2.007: Mon Jan 14 10:07:09 CET 2002

	Fixes:

        - [Alan Kelm] found a mistake in Mail::Box::Locker::DotLock::_try_lock

	- [Alan Kelm] updated some docs about locking.

	- [Alan Kelm] folder->new keep_dups option.

	- [Alan Kelm] fixed a stupid bug: messages printed to MBOX folders
	  did not get an empty line after them (before the from-line).
	  changed  print('') into print("\n") in Mail::Box::Mbox::Messages.pm
	  Mail::Box doesn't need that line, but other mail-agents might.

	Improvements:

	- Avoid colissions between two messages which falsily share
	  messageID.  One will get a new number.

	- Start implementing understanding of CRLF / CR and foreign
          line-endings

	- Implemented stricter checks.  When a body is created, it is
	  not trusted until the data is checked.  This is lazy again ;)
	  Specify the checked option for the body is you are sure the
	  data is correct.  Also for the folders: when they are `trusted',
	  all bodies will be created `checked', which boosts performance
	  when used with the Perl parser.

version 2.006: Wed Jan  2 08:27:21 CET 2002

	Fixes:

	- Accidentally typed   (@_)  as prototype of some methods.  Found
	  by [Jeffrey Friedl]

version 2.005: Sun Dec 30 14:25:22 CET 2001

	Fixes:

	- Because of a bug related to weak references in the 5.6.0
	  Perl core, 5.6.1 is required now...

	Improvements:

	- Rewrote Mail::Box::Parser::Perl, to avoid use of unget_line.
	  At the same time, the detection of the folder's line mode is
	  simplified.  However, not seek is sparsely used... maybe as
	  next improvement this could be avoided as well.

	- The performance is improved considerably when the folder
	  is trusted.  However, a little slowdown can be experienced
	  for untrusted folders, because better CRLF handling.

	- $mboxmsg->fileLocation returns only begin message in scalar
	  context.

	- readHeader returns ref-array for each field i.s.o. four
	  elements in a list.

	- Mail::Box::Parser::inDosmode is now called
	  Mail::Box::Parser::lineSeparator.  Although a start has been
	  made to support Windows and non-native folders, it is not
	  fully implemented yet.

	- Updated the Mail::Box::Parser manual-page.

version 2.004: Sun Dec 16 22:53:06 CET 2001

	Fixes:

	- I didn't know yet, but you can do things like:
	    $reply->head->add(To => $orig->head->get('From'));
	  because of stringification ;)

	- $message->from also may return the content of the Sender header.

	- Mail::Message::Construct::quotePrelude renamed to
	  ::replyPrelude, which is more consequent.

	New:

	- Added Mail::Message::Construct::forward() and ::forwardSubject.
	  With tests in t/57*

	- Replies are even more flexible now.

version 2.003: Sat Dec 15 00:47:50 CET 2001

	Fixes:

	- Moved stuff from Mail::Message::Head::read to
	  Mail::Box::Parser::readHeader to improve parser indepency and
	  speed.

	- [Marcel de Boer] showed me that labels were not treated
	  right in Mail::Box v2.  Moved from Mail::Box::Message to
	  Mail::Message and Mail::Message::Head.

	- [Marcel de Boer] also found a problem with cloning of multi-
	  parts which got solved: a Mail::Message::Part is cloned to
	  be a Mail::Message!

	- Quite a speed improvement too.

	- Changed version policy

version 2.002: Fri Dec 13 17:46:01 CET 2001

	Fixes:

	- Better (less complaining) recovery of bad header parsing.

	- Removed a back-reference from a locker object to the folder,
	  by which the folders where kept alive although out of scope.
	  "circular reference".  According the the errors I got when
	  removing this one, there should be no strong refs left.

	- replaced many "warn"s by "$self->log(WARNING =>"s in
	  Mail::Box::Manager.

	- Improved handling and creating folders in the Mail::Box::Manager.

	- A header may be empty, but then it will be 'false'.  This is
	  needed to correctly recover corrupted mbox folders.

	New:

	- Mail::Message::Field::Fast implements a fast but dirty way to
	  store the header information.  Tested in t/11field1.t
	  It saves about 10% memory and 7% performance.

	- Mail::Message::Field::Flex implements an extendible but slower
	  way to manage the data.  Tested in t/11field2.t

version 2.00_19: Wed Dec 12 22:13:56 CET 2001

	Most work about sending messages.  Slight extension of the
	interface for some other packages.

	Fixes:

	- Removed Tassilo's header parser optimization in favor of
	  split again, because it breaks on empty fields.

	- [Tassilo v Parsival] added some 'binmode OUT' lines to
	  make 98% of the tests succeed on Windows!!  But I am not
	  sure that is the right answer.  More on that later.

	New:

	- Added to/from/cc/bcc/subject methods to Mail::Message, to
	  hide Resent- header lines which overrule these fields in the
	  header.  Required for correct rfc822 support.

	- Added destinations() to Mail::Message.

	- Added isResent() to Mail::Message::Field.

	- Added addresses() to Mail::Message::Field, which returns a list
	  of addresses as specified by the header line.

	- Added pod reference to Mail::Message's service methods on header
	  lines.

	- Added Mail::Message::Head::Complete::printUndisclosed() and
	  Mail::Message::printUndisclosed() which is the same as print()
	  but leaving the Cc and Bcc headers out.

	- Added Mail::Transport::putContent($message)

	- Added Mail::Transport::SMTP shaped after Net/SMTP, but much more
	  facilities and real Perl 5 code!  Not ready yet.

version 2.00_18: Mon Dec 10 22:19:44 CET 2001

	- Added some requires for package FileHandle.

	- Added Mail::Transport::Qmail (cannot test it, but expect it
	  to work)

	- Reorganized (and improved the docs) on all Transport modules.

	- Added POSIX fcntl locking.

	- [Tassilo v Parsival] demonstrated the fastest way to split
	  a header, determined by benchmarking 6 variations on the theme.
	  Used in Mail::Box::Parser::Perl.pm

version 2.00_17: Sat Dec  8 23:10:06 CET 2001

	- Moved scripts/web/* to scripts/

	- Header line options in Mail::Message::Construct::reply start
	  with capitals too.

	- Added Mail::Message::Body::Multipart::stripSignature

	- Simplified Mail::Message::Construct::reply a little

	- Fixed problem with the resulting body-types where delayed bodies
	  where used to be encoded and decoded.

	- Extra checks for From-line in mbox folders, to help incorrectly
	  formatted folders.

	- [Tassilo v Parsival] discovered the problematic recovery for
	  erroneous headers.  Some recovery is tried.

version 2.00_16:  Sat Dec  8 16:56:53 CET 2001

	First beta of Mail::Box version 2

        Most import changes:

	* Replaced all use of MIME::Parser, Mail::Internet, and MIME::Entity,
	  althought the foreign message types are still useable in some
	  places.

	* All code has been changed.  Simple things, like opening a folder,
	  reading messages and such are the same.  However handling of
	  messages is really different from the MIME::Entity/Mail::Internet
	  implementation.  Your message handling must be body-oriented ;)
	  tranforming a body into a new body, into a new body, and
	  finally create a new message from it.  See Mail::Box-Cookbook.

	* Moved code to use 5.6.0 features, so no support for 5.005
	  anymore.  This is required for Inline::C and Unicode support.
	  Mail::Box releases below 2 will be supported for some time
	  for people with `old' perl.

	* Parsing in Inline::C or plain Perl

	* folder->open(take_headers) removed
	  folder->open(extract) replaces folder->open(lazy_extract) to
	  avoid double negation in your program.
	  listFolders became listSubFolders
          allMessages became messages(); so $folder->messages always
	  returns all.

	* Unfolding of headers considered stupid: headers which are
	  structured (check Mail::Message::Field::isStructured) may always
	  be multi-lined. Just specify the right options when you scan
	  through the line with regular expressions.

	* All packages is separate files.

	* Many more test, a few example files, Mail::Box-Overview and
	  Mail::Box-Cookbook.

Before this, we had Mail::Box-1.xyz which also has a Changelog.  Most of
that information is not really useful because version >=2.0 is a really,
really major change, although there is strike for compibility.

However, some of the bugfixes contributed for Mail::Box v1 are
still present in Mail::Box v2.

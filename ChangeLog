CHANGELOG of Mail::Box

All changes till now were made by Mark Overmeer <mark@overmeer.net>

version 1.002: Fri Feb 16 23:50:14 CET 2001

	* Better error messages for die and warn during tests.  Hope
	  to figure-out why Windows still gives some problems, but
	  I do not want to go out and look a machine with it :(
	* No changes to methods needed.

version 1.001: Sun Feb 11 17:20:35 CET 2001

	* Fixed documention on creation of Mail::Box::Message-s: don't!
	  You should do $folder->addMessage( <some MIME::Entity> )
	* Added $! to some error-messages.  I hope it helps in the
	  compilation reports of perl-testers, so I can see why the
	  Win* tests do not work.
	* No changes to methods needed.

version 1.000: Mon Feb  5 22:36:11 CET 2001

	* BETA!!!!
	* Using File::Spec everywhere where directories and sub-
	  directories are involved, so that the package may work
	  on Win*
	* Removed O_NONBLOCK for dotlock-files on Win*  Hope it
	  works.  Can anyone improve the port to Windows?
	* No changes on method-calls needed.

version 0.94: Sat Feb  3 13:09:00 CET 2001

	* Extracted Mail::Box::Mbox::Message* into a seperate file.
	* Extracted Mail::Box::MH::Message* into a seperate file.
	* Extracted Mail::Box::Tread into a seperate file.
	* The objects Mail::Box::{Mbox::MH}::Message::Runtime are renamed
	  to the slightly briever Mail::Box::{Mbox::MH}::Runtime.
	* The objects Mail::Box::{Mbox::MH}::Message::NotParsed are renamed
	  to the slightly briever Mail::Box::{Mbox::MH}::NotParsed.
	* Moved around with the text in manuals *a lot* to make access
	  easier.  Many pod improvements (I hope)

version 0.93: Fri Feb  2 16:16:09 CET 2001

	* Doc update only.  There where some mistakes against pod.

version 0.92: Tue Jan 30 21:22:57 CET 2001

	* Tested (and changed) creation of folders.
	* Tested (and changed) deletion of folders.
	* Added the `create' flag to open() in Manager.
	* Removed synchronize(), because it is covered by write()
	* listFolders() can be called as class and as instance method.

	Changed files:
		Mail/Box/MH.pm
		Mail/Box/Mbox.pm
		Mail/Box/Manager.pm
		Mail/t/2mbox5c.t
		Mail/t/3mh5c.t

	MH and Mbox implementation seem complete, but there may need
	more tests.  Try it out!  The full package will reach beta soon.

version 0.91: Wed Jan 17 00:39:08 CET 2001

	* Tested listFolder and such for MH.
		Mail/Box/MH.pm
		Mail/t/3mh5c.t

	* Removed 5.6 dependencies.  Hope it works for 5.005 now...
	  Tjeeee... pitty that most people still use 5.005.

	* Too many fixes, and major rewrite of code related to writing
	  of messages into folders.

	The code seems to stabelise, and I have reports of people using
	the code with success.

version 0.9: Sun Jan 14 12:18:38 CET 2001

	* More tests on threads, which resulted in quite some fixes.
	  I am sure that some things may be improved, still.
		Mail/Box/Threads.pm
		Mail/Box.pm
		Mail/Box/Messages.pm

	* The .mh_sequences file gave only little fight, so passes
	  the tests now.
		Mail/Box/MH.pm
		Mail/Box/Messages.pm
		Mail/t/3mh7s.t

	* Tested creation, listFolder and such of Mboxes.  It will
	  not work for MH folders yet.
		Mail/Box/Mbox.pm
		Mail/t/3mbox5c.t

	The number of tests grew to 130, so it is starting to look as
	if all trics are working.

version 0.8: Sat Jan 13 01:05:49 CET 2001

	* Removed in_reply_to() and references() from Mail::Box::Messages,
	  because they had only use in Mail::Box::Threads.

	* Implemented and tested thread detection.  See the test-files
	  on the results.
		Mail/Box/Threads.pm
		Mail/t/2mbox6t.t
		Mail/t/3mh6t.t

version 0.7:  Thu Jan  4 22:44:30 CET 2001

	* Changed `use v5.6.0' (which is perfect 5.6.0 code) into
	  `use 5.006' (which is understood by 5.005) in all modules.

	* Fixed call to messageID in MH-folder, before the header is read
	  to trigger the header to be read.
		Mail/Box/MH.pm

version 0.6:  Thu Jan  4 22:44:30 CET 2001

	* Simplified autoloading (a lot)  The reference to the object
	  does not change anymore when a message is converted from an
          Mail::Box::Message::NotParsed into a Mail::Box::Message.

	* Stricter treatment of coercions with coerce().

	* Reimplementation of Threads to be as lazy as possible.
	  Not Tested Yet!!!
		Mail/Box/Treads.pm

	* MH folders are even more lazy than they were: by default nothing
	  at all is read.  Only access of any header-line will cause a
	  read in a file.

	* Added `DELAY' option to Mail::Box::new(take_headers)

	* Added a message state transition diagram (which is really
	  complicated for MH folders) and much more other documentation
	  improvements

	* Added large number of tests (about 40), which all succeed ;)

	Nearly all files got changed, although I managed to keep the method
	interface rather stable: (by the way: this is still an alpha release!)
		Mail/Box/Mbox.pm
		Mail/Box/MH.pm
		Mail/Box/Message.pm

	  now documents that you can use regular-expressions and accepts
          'ALL' and 'REAL'.  New option realhead_type to indicate which
          type of header is used by MIME::Entity.
		Mail/Box.pm

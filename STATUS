STATUS

This program was written in December 2000.  This is quite recent, so
please check for a new version: new programs often get many changes
in their first months.

The release status is   ***** ALPHA *****
as long as not all methods are tested intensively.  Mbox folders are
better tested than MH-folders, especially because the AUTOLOAD-trics
are simpler for Mboxes.

Other folder-types will be implemented only when the beta phase is
reached: when the Mbox and MH implementation seem complete and stable.

Tested
======

In the `t' directory, there are quite a number of tests, but they only
test some parts of the program.  Other parts have been written, but are
not tested.  Everything you read in the manual-pages should be there.

   2mbox1r.t          reading
   2mbox2w.t          writing
   2mbox3d.t          delay loading
   2mbox4a.t          appending to opened and unopened folders
   2mbox5c.t          folders and sub-folders
